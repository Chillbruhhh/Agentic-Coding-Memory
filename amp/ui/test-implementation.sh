echo "🧪 Testing 3D Force Graph Implementation"
echo "========================================"

echo "✅ Phase 1: Library Integration - COMPLETE"
echo "   - Installed react-force-graph-3d and 3d-force-graph"
echo "   - Dependencies added successfully"

echo "✅ Phase 2: Data Transformation - COMPLETE"
echo "   - Created graphDataAdapter.ts with AMP object transformation"
echo "   - Added symbol type mapping and color schemes"
echo "   - Implemented cyberpunk theme configuration"

echo "✅ Phase 3: Component Creation - COMPLETE"
echo "   - ForceGraph3DComponent.tsx: Main 3D graph with interactions"
echo "   - GraphControls.tsx: Search and filtering controls"
echo "   - GraphLegend.tsx: Symbol type legend with statistics"

echo "✅ Phase 4: Integration - COMPLETE"
echo "   - Replaced old KnowledgeGraph component"
echo "   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces"
echo "   - Fixed compilation errors"

echo "✅ Phase 5: Styling - COMPLETE"
echo "   - Cyberpunk theme integration"
echo "   - Node colors: Functions (blue), Classes (red), Methods (green), Variables (yellow)"
echo "   - Animated link particles and hover effects"

echo "🎯 Implementation Summary:"
echo "========================="
echo "Files Created:"
echo "  - src/utils/graphDataAdapter.ts"
echo "  - src/utils/graphTheme.ts"
echo "  - src/components/ForceGraph3DComponent.tsx"
echo "  - src/components/GraphControls.tsx"
echo "  - src/components/GraphLegend.tsx"

echo ""
echo "Files Modified:"
echo "  - src/components/KnowledgeGraph.tsx (replaced with 3D force graph)"
echo "  - package.json (added react-force-graph-3d dependency)"

echo ""
echo "🚀 Ready for Testing:"
echo "===================="
echo "1. Start AMP server: cd server && cargo run"
echo "2. Start UI: npm run tauri:dev"
echo "3. Navigate to Knowledge Graph tab"
echo "4. Verify 901 symbols display in 3D force-directed layout"

echo ""
echo "✨ Expected Features:"
echo "==================="
echo "- 3D force-directed layout with natural clustering"
echo "- Interactive nodes with hover tooltips"
echo "- Animated link particles showing relationships"
echo "- Search and filter controls"
echo "- Symbol type legend with counts"
echo "- Cyberpunk theme matching app design"
echo "- Smooth camera controls (zoom, pan, rotate)"
